          During lockdown, a group of my friends and I took our Dungeon and
          Dragon adventures online. After sampling a few applications on the
          market I was inspired to build this MERN stack app to better suit our
          needs. This is still a work in progress.

          Slime game is just a fun little idea I wanted to bring to life,
          inspired by movies like The Blob. Built using C# and the Unity3D game
          engine. I also did some 3D modelling for this project.
